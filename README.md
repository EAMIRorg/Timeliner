# Timeliner
Timeliner is an application that allows real-time MIDI data from a keyboard to be displayed visually to facilitate music instruction. It was developed by Matt Pietrucha (http://mattpietrucha.com) and V.J. Manzo (http://vjmanzo.com) as part of the EAMIR project (http://eamir.org).

The source requires Max 7 or later and the EAMIR SDK package available through Max in the "Package Manager".
